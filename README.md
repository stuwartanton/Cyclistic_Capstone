**This is a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**

### About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

### Objective
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Data
The data that we will be using is Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data from last 12 months (November 2020 to October 2021). Data is approximately 1 GB. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. on this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

### Data Cleaning
- Different excel files were merged into a single file.
- Data was cleaned to remove duplicates, NA values, Zero values. 
- Then, Column names were cleaned. (Removed whitespaces)
- Data types of columns were converted (eg. Object to Date time). 
- New features were extracted from observed data. (eg. Date time to Day of the week)
